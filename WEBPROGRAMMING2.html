                The top-down approach is a problem-solving or design strategy where you
                start by understanding the overall system or problem and then break it
                own into smaller, more manageable components or sub-problems. It involves
                decomposing a complex system or task into simpler and more understandable parts,
                and then addressing each part in a systematic way.

            <p>
                The bottom-up approach is a problem-solving or design strategy where you
                start by understanding the smallest details or components of a system and then
                gradually build your way up to the overall solution. Instead of starting with a broad
                verview, you begin with the specifics and then integrate them into a larger framework

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong><br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Holistic View: Starts with a high-level overview, providing a comprehensive understanding.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>Early Planning: Allows for early planning and identification of major components and their
                            interactions.</li><br>
                        <li>Structured Design: Encourages a structured design process, making it easier to manage and
                            control.</li><br>
                        <li>Clear Roadmap: Provides a clear roadmap for development or problem-solving.</li><br>
                        <li>Efficient Resource Allocation: Resources can be allocated efficiently based on the overall
                            system architecture.</li><br><br>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong><br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Delayed Details: Detailed components are addressed later in the process, potentially leading
                            to delays in understanding specific requirements.</li><br>
                        <li>Less Flexibility: May be less flexible to changes or unexpected details that were not
                            considered in the initial high-level planning.</li><br>
                        <li>Risk of Oversimplification: There's a risk of oversimplifying complex components during the
                            initial planning.</li><br>
                    </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong><br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Early Details: Addresses detailed components or smaller problems early in the process,
                            allowing for a deep understanding.</li><br>
                        <li>Flexibility: More adaptable to changes or unexpected details as components are developed
                            independently.</li><br>
                        <li>Incremental Progress: Allows for incremental progress, making it easier to track and manage.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>Detailed Testing: Enables detailed testing of individual components before integration into
                            the larger system.</li><br>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong><br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lack of Overall Direction: May lack an overall direction or structure until smaller
                            components are assembled.</li><br>
                        <li>Integration Challenges: Integration of individual components into a cohesive whole may
                            present challenges.</li><br>
                        <li>Potential for Redundancy: There's a risk of redundant efforts if multiple teams are working
                            on similar components independently.</li><br><br>
                    </ul>
