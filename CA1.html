            Computational thinking is a problem-solving and cognitive skill set that involves approaching complex problems in a way that a computer, or a human with a computational mindset, might tackle them.
            <br>

            <br>
            Key components of computational thinking include:<br><br>
            
            <li>Modularisation</li>
            <li>Decomposition (Big part of Modularisation)</li>
            <li>Abstraction</li>
            <li>Pattern Recognition</li>
            <li>Abstraction</li><br>
            
            By applying computational thinking to an overarching problem, you can understand what the problem is and what it consists of.<br><br>

            Modularisation
            <br><br><br>
            the APPROACH of breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable "modules" or components.
            <br><br>
            This approach enables a comprehensive understanding of the problem's requirements, facilitates the identification of patterns, and allows for the reuse and implementation of existing solutions. 
            <br><br>
            All of these modules work together to provide a solution to the initial problem, this strategy is often used in object oriented programming.
            <br><br>

            Using Modularisation will allow you to Use Two Techniques, Top-Down and Bottom-Up approach.
        </h6>
        <button class="accordion">TOP-DOWN APPROACH</button>
        <div class="panel2">

            <p>
                The top-down approach is a problem-solving or design strategy where you
                start by understanding the overall system or problem and then break it
                own into smaller, more manageable components or sub-problems.
                <br><br>
                It involves decomposing a complex system or task into simpler and more understandable parts,
                and then addressing each part in a systematic way.
            </p>

        <button class="accordion">BOTTOM-UP APPROACH</button>
        <div class="panel2">
            <p>
                The bottom-up approach is a problem-solving or design strategy where you start by understanding the smallest details or components of a system and then
                gradually build your way up to the overall solution. Instead of starting with a broadverview, you begin with the specifics and then integrate them into a larger framework
            </p>

        <h6 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.308)5b;">
            Decomposition
            <br><br><br>
            This is the technique of breaking a complex problem or system into smaller, more manageable parts.
            <br><br>
            These parts, often referred to as modules, can be developed independently and then integrated to form a complete solution.
            <br><br>
            By using decomposition, complex problems become easier to solve, as each module addresses a specific part of the overall problem.
        </h6>
        <h6>
            Abstraction
            <br><br>
            This is the approach of analyzing a problem and then removing all unimportant or low-priority parts to focus only on the essential aspects. This process helps in managing complexity by highlighting the crucial elements and ignoring the irrelevant details.
