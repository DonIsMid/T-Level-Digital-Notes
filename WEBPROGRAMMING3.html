        <h6 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.623)5b;">
            Information technology (IT) is the use of any computers, storage, networking and other physical devices, infrastructure and processes to create, process, store, secure and exchange all forms of electronic data.<br>
            We started by learning about Computational thinking and what the processes are.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Computational thinking is a problem-solving and cognitive skill set that involves approaching complex<br>
            problems in a way that a computer, or a human with a computational mindset, might tackle them. It's a
            fundamental<br>
            skill in computer science and is applicable to a wide range of disciplines beyond just programming.<br>
            <br>
            Key components of computational thinking include:<br><br>

            Decomposition: Breaking down a complex problem or system into smaller, more manageable parts or
            components.<br><br>

            Pattern Recognition: Identifying similarities and patterns within problems to facilitate the development of
            general solutions.<br><br>

            Abstraction: Removing unnecessary details to focus on the key elements of a problem. This involves creating
            models or representations that capture the essential aspects.<br><br>

            Algorithmic Thinking: Developing step-by-step instructions or procedures for solving a problem. Algorithms
            are precise sets of instructions for solving specific problems.<br><br>

            Debugging and Troubleshooting: The ability to find and fix errors or problems in a solution. This is a
            crucial aspect of computational thinking, as it involves identifying and correcting mistakes in algorithms
            and code.<br><br>

            Computational thinking is not limited to computer scientists; it's a valuable skill for anyone involved in
            problem-solving across various domains. It encourages a systematic and logical approach to problem-solving,
            helping individuals think more clearly and rigorously about problems, whether they are related to
            technology, science, business, or everyday life.<br><br>
